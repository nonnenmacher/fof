The different form types
------------------------

As implied above, there are three types of XML forms available in FOF: Browse, Read and Edit. Each one follows slightly different conventions and is used in different tasks of each MVC triad. In this section we are going to present what each of those types does and what is its structure.

There a few things you should know before we go into more details.

All form files are placed in your view's `tmpl` directory, e.g. components/com_example/views/items/tmpl.

All form files' names begin with `form.` and end with `.xml`. This is required for Joomla! to distinguish them from view metadata XML files. The middle part of their name follows the same convention as the regular view template files, i.e. "default" for browse tasks, "form" for edit tasks and "item" for read tasks.

For example, the browse form for com_example's items view is located in components/com_example/views/items/tmpl/form.default.xml whereas the form for editing a single item is located in components/com_example/views/item/tmpl/form.form.xml

### Browse forms

Browse forms are used to create a records list view. They are typically used in the back-end to allow the user to view and manipulate a list of records. A typical browse form looks like this:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<form
		lessfiles="media://com_todo/css/backend.less||media://com_todo/css/backend.css"
		type="browse"
		show_header="1"
		show_filters="1"
		show_pagination="1"
		norows_placeholder="COM_TODO_COMMON_NORECORDS"
	>
		<headerset>
			<header name="ordering" type="ordering" sortable="true" tdwidth="1%" />
			<header name="todo_item_id" type="rowselect" tdwidth="20" />
			<header name="title" type="fieldsearchable" sortable="true"
				buttons="yes" buttonclass="btn"
			/>
			<header name="due" type="field" sortable="true" tdwidth="12%" />
			<header name="enabled" type="published" sortable="true" tdwidth="8%" />
		</headerset>

		<fieldset name="items">
			<field name="ordering" type="ordering" labelclass="order"/>

			<field name="todo_item_id" type="selectrow"/>

			<field name="title" type="text"
				show_link="true"
				url="index.php?option=com_todo&amp;view=item&amp;id=[ITEM:ID]"
				class="todoitem"
				empty_replacement="(no title)"
			 />

			<field name="due" type="duedate" />

			<field name="enabled" type="published"/>
		</fieldset>
	</form>

You MUST have exactly one `<headerset>` and one `<fieldset>` tag. The `name` attribute of the `<fieldset>` MUST always be "items". Extra tags and/or `<fieldset>` tags with different name attributes (or no name attributes) will be ignored.

#### Form attributes

The enclosing `<form>` tag MUST have the following attributes:

**type**
:	It must be always set to "browse" for FOF to recognise this as a Browse form

The enclosing `<form>` tag MAY have one or more of the following attributes:

**lessfiles**
:	FOF allows you to include LESS files to customise the styling of your components. You can give a comma separated list of LESS files' identifiers (see the "Media files identifiers" section below) to be loaded by FOF. For example:

	media://com_example/less/backend.less

Compiled LESS files are cached in the `media/lib_fof/compiled` directory for efficiency reasons, using a mangled filename for privacy/security reasons. They are not written in your site's `cache` or `adminstrator/cache` directory as these directories *are not* supposed to be web-accessible, whereas the compiled CSS files, by definition, need to be web-accessible.

Since LESS files require a lot of memory and time to compile you can also provide an alternative pre-compiled CSS file, separated from your LESS file with two bars. For example:

	media://com_example/less/backend.less||media://com_example/css/backend.css

**cssfiles**
:	This works in the same manner as the *lessfiles* directive, but you are only supposed to specify standard CSS files. The CSS files are defined using identifiers, too. For example:

	media://com_example/css/backend.css

Please note that media file overrides rules are in effect for these CSS files.

**jsfiles**
:	Works the same way as *cssfiles*, but it's used to load Javascript files. The Javascript files are defined using identifiers, too. For example:

	media://com_example/js/backend.js

Please note that media file overrides rules are in effect for these Javascript files.

**show_header**
:	Should we display the header section of the browse form? This is the place where the field titles are displayed.

**show_filters**
:	Should we show the filter section of the browse form? On Joomla! 2.5 this is the area below the header where the user can filter the display based on his own criteria. On Joomla! 3.0 and later this area is rendered in the sidebar, at the left hand side of the records list.

**show_pagination**
:	Should we show the pagination results? That's the links to the first, second, third, â€¦, last page and the drop-down for the number of items per page. It is displayed below the list of records.

**norows_placeholder**
:	A translation key displayed instead of a records list when the current view contains no records, e.g. the table is empty or the filters limit display to zero records.

### Read forms

While browse views display a list of records, read forms will display just a single record. These are nowhere near as powerful as hand-coded PHP-based view templates but can be used to get a quick single item output in a snatch when prototyping a component or when your data is really simple. A typical read form looks like this:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<form
		lessfiles="media://com_todo/css/frontend.less||media://com_todo/css/frontend.css"
		type="read"
	>
		<fieldset name="a_single_item" class="todo-item-container form-horizontal">
			<field name="title" type="text"
				label=""
				class="todo-title-field"
				size="50"
			 />

			<field name="due" type="duedate"
				label="COM_TODO_ITEMS_FIELD_DUE"
				labelclass="todo-field"
				size="20"
				default="NOW"
			 />
			<field name="description" type="editor"
				label=""
			/>
		</fieldset>
	</form>

You MUST have at least one `<fieldset>` tag. The `name` attribute of the `<fieldset>` is indifferent.

#### Form attributes

The enclosing `<form>` tag MUST have the following attributes:

**type**
:	It must be always set to "read" for FOF to recognise this as a Read form

The enclosing `<form>` tag MAY have one or more of the following attributes:

**lessfiles**
:	FOF allows you to include LESS files to customise the styling of your components. You can give a comma separated list of LESS files' identifiers (see the "Media files identifiers" section below) to be loaded by FOF. For example:

	media://com_example/less/backend.less

They are not written in your site's `cache` or `adminstrator/cache` directory as these directories *are not* supposed to be web-accessible, whereas the compiled CSS files, by definition, need to be web-accessible.

	media://com_example/less/backend.less||media://com_example/css/backend.css

**cssfiles**
:	This works in the same manner as the *lessfiles* directive, but you are only supposed to specify standard CSS files. The CSS files are defined using identifiers, too. For example:

	media://com_example/css/backend.css

Please note that media file overrides rules are in effect for these CSS files.

**jsfiles**
:	Works the same way as *cssfiles*, but it's used to load Javascript files. The Javascript files are defined using identifiers, too. For example:

	media://com_example/js/backend.js

Please note that media file overrides rules are in effect for these Javascript files.

### Edit forms

Edit forms are used to edit a single record. They are typically used in the back-end. If you want to use an Edit form in the front-end you will need to specialise your Toolbar class to render a front-end toolbar in the edit task of this specific view, otherwise the form will not be able to be submitted (unless you do other tricks, outside the scope of this developers' documentation).

An edit form looks like this:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<form
		lessfiles="media://com_todo/css/backend.less||media://com_todo/css/backend.css"
		validate="true"
	>
		<fieldset name="basic_configuration"
			label="COM_TODO_ITEMS_GROUP_BASIC"
			description="COM_TODO_ITEMS_GROUP_BASIC_DESC"
			class="span6"
		>
			<field name="title" type="text"
				class="inputbox"
				label="COM_TODO_ITEMS_FIELD_TITLE"
				labelclass="todo-label todo-label-main"
				required="true"
				size="50"
			 />

			<field name="due" type="calendar"
				class="inputbox"
				label="COM_TODO_ITEMS_FIELD_DUE"
				labelclass="todo-label"
				required="true"
				size="20"
				default="NOW"
			 />
			<field name="enabled" type="list" label="JSTATUS"
				labelclass="todo-label"
				description="JFIELD_PUBLISHED_DESC" class="inputbox"
				filter="intval" size="1" default="1"
			>
				<option value="1">JPUBLISHED</option>
				<option value="0">JUNPUBLISHED</option>
			</field>
		</fieldset>
		<fieldset name="description_group"
			label="COM_TODO_ITEMS_GROUP_DESCRIPTION"
			description="COM_TODO_ITEMS_GROUP_DESCRIPTION_DESC"
			class="span6"
		>
			<field name="description" type="editor"
				label=""
				class="inputbox"
				required="false"
				filter="JComponentHelper::filterText" buttons="true"
			/>
		</fieldset>
	</form>

#### Form attributes

The enclosing `<form>` tag MAY have one or more of the following attributes:

**lessfiles**
:	FOF allows you to include LESS files to customise the styling of your components. You can give a comma separated list of LESS files' identifiers (see the "Media files identifiers" section below) to be loaded by FOF. For example:

	media://com_example/js/backend.js

Please note that media file overrides rules are in effect for these Javascript files.

**validation**
: Set it to true to have Joomla! load its unobtrusive Javascript validation script. Please note that FOF does not perform automatic server-side validation checks. This is the responsibility of your specialised Table class and its check() method.

### Formatting your forms

OK, granted, the automatically rendered forms are a timesaver but, by default, they look terrible. This is quite expected. It's like comparing a rug churned out by a mechanised production line (the automatically rendered form) and a hand-stiched persian rug (the hand-coded PHP-based view template). The good news is that, unlike rugs, there's some room of improvement with XML forms.

For starters, the `<fieldset>`s of Edit and Read forms, as well as the fields themselves, can be assigned CSS classes and IDs which can help you provide a custom style. Moreover, you can mix XML forms and PHP-based view templates to further customise the display of your forms. 

In this section we will cover both customisation methods. If this doesn't sound enough for your project you can always use hand-coded PHP-based view templates, much like how you did since Joomla! 1.5.0. It's up to you to decide which method is best for your project!

#### Assigning classes and IDs to `<fieldset>`s

Each fieldset of a Read and Edit form can have the following optional attributes:

**class**:
One or more CSS classes to be applied to the generated `<div>` element.

**name**:
The value of this attribute is applied to the `id` attribute of the generated `<div>` element.

**label**:
The value of this attribute is rendered as a level 3 heading (`<h3>`) element at the top of the generated `<div>` element.

If you are using the optional Akeeba Strapper package (which back ports Bootstrap to Joomla! 2.5) or Joomla! 3 you can use Bootstrap's classes to create visually interesting interfaces. For example, using `class="span6 pull-left"` will create a half-page-wide left floating sidebar out of your field set.

#### Mixing XML forms with PHP-based view templates

Inside your .php view template file you can use `$this->getRenderedForm()` to return the XML form file rendered as HTML. This allows you to customise the layout (e.g. adding information before/after the form) while still using the XML file to render the actual form.

To use this approach, simply insert this code in your custom .php template file:

```
<?php
$viewTemplate = $this->getRenderedForm();
echo $viewTemplate; 
?>
```
